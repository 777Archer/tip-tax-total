# tip-tax-total

Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, and then calculate the amount of a 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total.

Hint: Use "0.2f" to format tax and tip rates, and "8.2f" to format dollar amounts.
